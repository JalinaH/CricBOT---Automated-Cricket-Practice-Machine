# CricBOT: Automated Cricket Practice Machine

## Overview

CricBOT is an automated cricket practice machine developed as our first-year IoT hardware project. It allows users to practice cricket by selecting ball type, ball count, and delay using a keypad, and displays the selections on an LCD screen. The machine also indicates errors (safety checks, ball checks, ball jams) using the LCD, buzzer, and LED. Additionally, CricBOT can be controlled via a mobile app for enhanced user experience.
